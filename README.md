# SimplyCalc

Calculator built using Math.js, inspired by [Caligator](https://github.com/sarthology/caligator).

Supports custom functions and variables. Also supports most of the functions that Mathjs has *([Mathjs functions](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html))*.

Supports conversions from different lengths and weights.

-----

> Starting with version **0.3.0** the project will be removing Electron and focusing 100% on the web version of the calculator. If in the future enough demand for an Electron app exists, then a simple Electron wrapper will be created.
> *Due to this change the project will be renamed.*
